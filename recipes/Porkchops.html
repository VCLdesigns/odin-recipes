<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 (1-inch thick) boneless pork loin chops</li>

  <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

  <li>2 tablespoons garlic-infused olive oil</li>

  <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

  <li>1 medium onion, sliced lengthwise</li>

  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

  <li>2 cups chopped tomatoes, with juices</li>

  <li>½ cup sliced poblano-stuffed green olives</li>

  <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>

  <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced lengthwise</li>

  <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>

  <li>
    2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 sprigs fresh Mexican oregano 2 tablespoons chopped
  </li>

  <li>cilantro ½ lime</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Use a paper towel to pat pork chops dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides.
  </li>

  <li>
    Heat olive oil and butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until butter is melted and oil is shimmering. Carefully add pork chops and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat and set aside.
  </li>

  <li>
    Add onion slices to the same skillet. Saute, stirring frequently, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and stir for about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, olives, capers, jalapeno strips, bay leaves, thyme, and oregano. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Nestle chops into the vegetable mixture and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes. Place chops on a serving plate and increase heat to medium-high. Discard bay leaves and herb sprigs. Cook until liquid is reduced and thickened, about 3 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>Spoon vegetables and sauce over chops. Garnish with cilantro. Squeeze lime juice over all. Serve warm.</li>
</ol>
